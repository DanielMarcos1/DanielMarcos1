ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel, brazilian, tech lover and self-taught student.

I'm trying to spend my free time as a college student to make an impact in the world of software development, so I chose to contribute to open-source software.

I'm quite interested on learning things than something specific, so i'm spending a lot of time on github topics trying to find something that makes sense.
